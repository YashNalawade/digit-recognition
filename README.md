# Digit Recognition
Implemented handwritten Digit Recognition using Python(Keras) and MNIST dataset.

Created the CNN model using overall 8 layers. Added canvas using Tkinter for GUI and did some preprocessing for better accuracy.

Completed the project in two parts:

1. Trained the model using 60,000 training images of handwritten digits and saved it.
2. Loaded the saved model and predicted the captured image after preprocessing(padding and resizing)
